The purpose of this application is to read output lines from <stdin> (such as
tailing a log or an application's output) and then generating a graph of the 
values.  The values extracted are matched with a regex, using '-r'; or using 
pre-defined values, using '-p'.

Run 'pipegraph -h' to see commandline options.
